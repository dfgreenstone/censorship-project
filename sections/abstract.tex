Taiwan is often seen as a bastion of free speech and liberal democracy. However, its antagonistic neighbor China has tried to influence its elections through
online disinformation. In this project, I study the censorship Taiwan has performed to try to prevent this disinformation from affecting its democracy. I argue
that though the media portrays Taiwan as censorship-free, this is not completely true. Taiwan may be directly censoring Chinese news and government sources, as
well as North Korean and Muslim websites. In addition, certain "morally questionable" topics may be undergoing light censorship. However, Taiwan does remain
fairly light on censorship in the grand scheme of things, instead relying on citizen activism and awareness to fight fake news.
